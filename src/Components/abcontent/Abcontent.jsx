          The Rise of Thangaraj in Matchstick Exports - From Local to Global
        </h1>
        <h3>Lighting Lives Since 1979 </h3>
        <p>
          Founded with a mission to bring employment and ignite progress in
          rural Tamil Nadu, Thangaraj Match Factory stands today as one of the
          most respected names in the safety match industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began in 1979, when Shri M.T.M. Thangaraj established Ravi
          Match Industries in the quiet village of Erachi. At a time when
          agriculture was the only livelihood, this humble factory brought
          meaningful employment and hope to the people of the region. His
          commitment to quality and community laid the foundation for a legacy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>With relentless dedication, Shri Thangaraj expanded operations.</p>

          </ul>
        <p>
          These units operated entirely through handmade and manpower-driven
          methods and at their peak, our group had outsourced production to over
          25 small-scale units in and around Kovilpatti, making us one of the
          leading safety match manufacturers in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our flagship brand, <span>"THE HORSE"</span> , became a household name
          across North India, known for its consistency, quality and striking
          reliability.

            launched our first semi-automatic unit ‚Äì The Ratham Match Industries
